  Copyright Microsoft Corporation
  Compiled Apr  5 2012 at 12:43:45 by BOBD02 for Linux
  using MKL v10.03.07 - Build: 20111003

 ++    Start Processing CommandLine:

Description:
  FastLmmC computes Linear Mixed Model GWAS

Usage:
  FastLmmC -option <parameter>

  -file basefilename
       basename for PLINK's .map and .ped files

  -bfile basefilename
       basename for PLINK's binary .bed .fam, and .bin files

  -tfile basefilename
       basename for PLINK's transposed .tfam and .tped files

  -dfile basefilename
       basename for PLINK's dosage .dat, .fam, and optional .map files

  -pheno filename
       name of phenotype file

  -mpheno index
       index for phenotype in -pheno file to process, starting at 1 
       for the first phenotype column. Cannot be used together with 
       -pheno-name. Default: 1.

  -pheno-name phenotypeName
       phenotype name for phenotype in -pheno file to process.  If 
       this option is used, the phenotype name must be specified in 
       the header row.  Cannot be used together with -mpheno.

  -numjobs <int>
       Partion the SNPS into <int> groups and run FaSTLMM on the 
       partition specified by -thisjob
       Requires thisjob to be set too.

  -thisjob <int>
       Specifies which partition of SNPS created by -numjobs to 
       process with FaSTLMM
       Requires numjobs to be set too.

  -extract filename
       This is a SNP filter option.  FaSTLMM will only analyze the
       SNPs explicitly listed in the 'filename'

  -extractSim filename
       This is a genetic similarity SNP filter option.  FaSTLMM will
       only use SNPs explicitly listed in the 'filename' for computing
       genetic similarity.

  -extractSimTopK filename <int>
       Similar to -extractSim, this is a genetic similarity SNP filter
       option.  FaSTLMM will only use the first <int> SNPs explicitly
       listed in the 'filename' for computing genetic similarity.

  -fileSim basefilename
       basename for PLINK's .map and .ped files for computing 
       genetic similarity

  -bfileSim basefilename
       basename for PLINK's binary .bed, .fam, and .bin files for 
       building genetic similarity

  -tfileSim basefilename
       basename for PLINK's transposed .tfam and .tped files for 
       building genetic similarity

  -dfileSim basefilename
       basename for PLINK's dosage .dat, .fam, and optional .map 
       files for building genetic similarity

  -sim filename
       file containing the genetic similarity matrix in tab-delimited 
       ascii double values (overrides -fileSim)

  -simOut filename
       write out genetic similarity matrix to filename in tab-delimited 
       ascii double values

  -covar filename
       optional file containing the covariates

  -missingPhenotype <dbl>
       identifier for missing values.  If the phenotype for an 
       individual is missing, then the individual is ignored.  
       If a covariate value for an individual is missing, then 
       it is mean imputed.

  -out filename
       the name of the output file. 
       Default value is [basefilename].out.txt

  -verboseOut
       Write more detailed information to the output file.
       This includes things like logDelta, GeneticVar, etc.

  -ML
       use maximum likelihood parameter learning (default ML)

  -REML
       use restricted Maximum likelihood parameter learning (default ML)

  -simLearnType [FULL/ONCE]
       if set to Once (the default), then delta, the ratio of residual 
       to genetic covariance, is optimized only for the null model and 
       used for each alternate model. If set to Full, then the ratio 
        is re-estimated for each alternative model.

  -simType [RRM/COVARIANCE]
       if set to RRM (the default), then the RRM is used for genetic 
       similarity.  If set to COVARIANCE, then the empirical SNP 
       covariance matrix is used.

  -brentStarts <int>
       number of interval boundary points for optimization of delta 
       (see Section 2.1 of the Supplemental Information).  
       Default: 100.

  -brentMaxIter <int>
       maximum  number of iterations per interval for the 
       optimization of delta.  Default: 1e5.

  -brentMinLogVal <dbl>
       lower interval threshold for (log) delta optimization. 
       Default: -10.

  -brentMaxLogVal <dbl>
       upper interval treshold for (log) delta optimization.
       Default: 10.

  -brentTol <dbl>
       convergence tolerance of Brentï¿½s method used to optimize delta.
       Default: 1e-6.

  -HWE
       use the Hardy-Weinberg estimate for the SNP variance instead 
       of empirical estimate. This option is recommended for sample 
       sizes that are too small for accurate variance estimation.

  -runGwasType [RUN/NORUN]
       run GWAS or exit after computing the spectral decomposition of 
       the genetic similarity matrix. Use NORUN, to cache the spectral 
       decomposition.  This option, in combination with the next, is 
       useful for parallelizing the tests of many SNPs. Default: RUN.

  -eigen directoryname
       load the spectral decomposition object from the directoryname.  
       When specified, the computations leading to the spectral 
       decomposition of the genetic similarity matrix are skipped 
       (note that that SNP file specifying the genetic similarities 
       must still be given).

  -eigenOut directoryname
       save the spectral decomposition object to the directoryname. 
       May be used with -runGwasType option.

  -logDelta <dbl>
       use a pre-specified log(delta) for both null and alternative models

  -linReg
       use a linear regression model instead of a linear mixed model

  -groups [filename]
       specifies the filename

  -simGroups [filename]
       file containing the group-by-group similarity matrix

  Configuration Options:

  -MaxChromosomeValue <int>
       PLINK format specified human chromosome numbers and are thus
       limited to 0-26 (1-23, x=23, y=24, xy=25, mt=26).  Use
       MaxChromosomeValue specifies a different limit for the
       chromosome number.

  Debug Options:

  -Verbose
       optionally print out log-likelihoods of null and alternative 
       models to the standard output

  -Log
       Log tells the program to write more progress and debug data
       to a series of *.log files.

  -LogDir [directory name]
       LogDir implies -log and sets the directory to write the output
       Default: .\Logs

  -MaxThreads <int>
       Suggests the number of threads for the math library to use

-------------------------------------------------------------------
A sample command would be:
  fastlmmc -tfile geno_test -tfileSim geno_cov -pheno pheno.txt -covar covariate.txt

  This requires the following input files:

    geno_test.tfam, geno_test.tped
      These use PLINKs transposed file format for the test SNPs

    geno_cov.tfam, geno_cov.tped
      Same format for the SNPs used to compute the RRM

    pheno.txt
      PLINKs alternate phenotype file

    covariate.txt
      The covariate file follows PLINKs covariate file format. 
      No header line is allowed.

  This produces geno_test.output.txt in the same location 
  as geno_test files.
